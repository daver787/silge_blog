## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r post_offices}
post_offices %>%
  count(state,name, sort=TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r hawaii, echo=FALSE}
post_offices %>%
  filter(state == "HI")%>%
  pull(name)
```
```{r}
library(tidymodels)
set.seed(123)
po_split <- post_offices %>%
  mutate(state = case_when(state =="HI"~"Hawaii",
                           TRUE~"Other"))%>%
  select(name,state)%>%
  initial_split(strata = state)

po_train <- training(po_split)
po_test <- testing(po_split)
po_folds <- vfold_cv(po_train,strata = state)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
